# Emergency vehicle light Control
Light control for emergency (model) vehicles.

## Aim of the project
The aim of this project was to create a simple sketch which controls four independent emergency (model) vehicle light groups. This could be needed to build a model of a car / train or any other accident.

## Introduction
This Software was originally programed for an [ESP32-S2-Saola-1](https://amzn.to/3UJ6Ole) but any other microcontroller with at least 4 timers can be used as well. 
With slide changes groups can be added or removed in order to use an other microcontroller.

## Pin-out
Regarding to the pin-setup configuration in the [main](https://github.com/AndyyF/emergency-vehicle-lightcontrol/blob/main/emergency_vehicle_light/src/main.cpp) code from line 52 to 70 the used pins have to be implemented.

## Configuration
In order to use a certain amount of pin groups you have to modify the line 45 in the [main](https://github.com/AndyyF/emergency-vehicle-lightcontrol/blob/main/emergency_vehicle_light/src/main.cpp) code.
